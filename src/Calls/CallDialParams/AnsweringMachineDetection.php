/**
 * Enables Answering Machine Detection. Telnyx offers Premium and Standard detections. With Premium detection, when a call is answered, Telnyx runs real-time detection and sends a `call.machine.premium.detection.ended` webhook with one of the following results: `human_residence`, `human_business`, `machine`, `silence` or `fax_detected`. If we detect a beep, we also send a `call.machine.premium.greeting.ended` webhook with the result of `beep_detected`. If we detect a beep before `call.machine.premium.detection.ended` we only send `call.machine.premium.greeting.ended`, and if we detect a beep after `call.machine.premium.detection.ended`, we send both webhooks. With Standard detection, when a call is answered, Telnyx runs real-time detection to determine if it was picked up by a human or a machine and sends an `call.machine.detection.ended` webhook with the analysis result. If `greeting_end` or `detect_words` is used and a `machine` is detected, you will receive another `call.machine.greeting.ended` webhook when the answering machine greeting ends with a beep or silence. If `detect_beep` is used, you will only receive `call.machine.greeting.ended` if a beep is detected.
