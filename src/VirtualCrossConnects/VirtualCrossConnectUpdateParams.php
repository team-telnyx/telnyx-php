 * An object containing the method's parameters.

 * $params = (new VirtualCrossConnectUpdateParams); // set properties as needed
 * $client->virtualCrossConnects->update(...$params->toArray());
 * ```
 * Update the Virtual Cross Connect.<br /><br />Cloud IPs can only be patched during the `created` state, as GCE will only inform you of your generated IP once the pending connection requested has been accepted. Once the Virtual Cross Connect has moved to `provisioning`, the IPs can no longer be patched.<br /><br />Once the Virtual Cross Connect has moved to `provisioned` and you are ready to enable routing, you can toggle the routing announcements to `true`.
